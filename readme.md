Welcome to my music library!

This is a project as part of my bootcamp with Manchester Codes, to learn more about back-end, databases, SQL, sequelize and express. 

As a DJ for over 12 years, there's been a fair amount of bangers building up so this is also hopefully quite useful! 

This readme will update as I add extra features. Enjoy!
